# Calculator with Electron, TypeScript, React

An exercise in Electron. Electron is a cross-platform framework for desktop applications that runs off of Chromium. This allows a web development skillset to be applied to developing desktop applications across multiple platforms.

The Webpack configs were written from scratch for practice. For future Electron projects, I would rather start with a reliable template such as with [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/templates/typescript-+-webpack-template).

## Install

```
npm install
npm run build-pug
npm run build-preload
npm start
```
